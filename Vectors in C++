Vectors in C++
Vectors are dynamic arrays in C++ that can resize themselves automatically when elements are added or removed. They are part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and provide a flexible way to work with collections of data.

Key Features of Vectors
- Dynamic size: Vectors can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.
- Random access: Vectors provide random access to elements, allowing you to access any element directly using its index.
- Insertion and deletion: Vectors support insertion and deletion of elements at any position, including the beginning and end.

Vector Operations
- push_back(): adds an element to the end of the vector
- insert(): inserts an element at a specified position
- erase(): removes an element from a specified position
- size(): returns the number of elements in the vector
- capacity(): returns the maximum number of elements the vector can hold without resizing
- resize(): changes the size of the vector
