A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element is a separate object, known as a node, which contains two items:

1. Data: The actual data stored in the node.
2. Next: A reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

Key Characteristics
1. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Linked lists use dynamic memory allocation, which means that memory is allocated or deallocated as nodes are added or removed.
2. Non-Contiguous Memory: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations.
3. Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes at any position in the list.

Types of Linked Lists
1. Singly Linked List: Each node has a reference to the next node in the sequence.
2. Doubly Linked List: Each node has references to both the previous and next nodes in the sequence.
3. Circularly Linked List: The last node in the sequence points back to the first node, forming a circle.

Advantages
1. Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes at any position in the list.
2. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Linked lists use dynamic memory allocation, which means that memory is allocated or deallocated as nodes are added or removed.

Disadvantages
1. Random Access is Not Allowed: Linked lists do not allow for random access to elements, as each node can only be accessed by traversing the list from the beginning.
2. Extra Memory for Pointers: Linked lists require extra memory to store the pointers to the next node in the sequence.

Applications
1. Database Query Results: Linked lists can be used to store the results of a database query, where each node represents a row in the result set.
2. Browser History: Linked lists can be used to implement browser history, where each node represents a webpage visited by the user.
3. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Linked lists are useful in situations where dynamic memory allocation is required, such as in systems with limited memory.

Common Operations
1. Insertion: Adding a new node to the list.
2. Deletion: Removing a node from the list.
3. Traversal: Iterating through the nodes in the list.
4. Search: Finding a specific node in the list.
