Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. C++ provides various types of operators, including:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
    - + (addition)
    - - (subtraction)
    - * (multiplication)
    - / (division)
    - % (modulus)
2. Comparison Operators:
    - == (equal to)
    - != (not equal to)
    - > (greater than)
    - < (less than)
    - >= (greater than or equal to)
    - <= (less than or equal to)
3. Logical Operators:
    - && (logical AND)
    - || (logical OR)
    - ! (logical NOT)
4. Assignment Operators:
    - = (assignment)
    - += (addition assignment)
    - -= (subtraction assignment)
    - *= (multiplication assignment)
    - /= (division assignment)
