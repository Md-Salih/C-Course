Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. C++ provides various types of operators, including:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
    - + (addition)
    - - (subtraction)
    - * (multiplication)
    - / (division)
    - % (modulus)
2. Comparison Operators:
    - == (equal to)
    - != (not equal to)
    - > (greater than)
    - < (less than)
    - >= (greater than or equal to)
    - <= (less than or equal to)
3. Logical Operators:
    - && (logical AND)
    - || (logical OR)
    - ! (logical NOT)
4. Assignment Operators:
    - = (assignment)
    - += (addition assignment)
    - -= (subtraction assignment)
    - *= (multiplication assignment)
    - /= (division assignment)

// Working of increment and decrement operators

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 100, result_a, result_b;

    // incrementing a by 1 and storing the result in result_a
    result_a = ++a;
    cout << "result_a = " << result_a << endl;


    // decrementing b by 1 and storing the result in result_b   
    result_b = --b;
    cout << "result_b = " << result_b << endl;

    return 0;
}
